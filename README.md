# My LittleLink Installation

LittleLink is a lightweight DIY alternative to services like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee). LittleLink was built using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a dead simple, responsive boilerplate.

It has been heavily customized from the source project to support additional types of buttons and serve miscellaneous web content.
